# NoSQL_WorkoutTracker

## Description

For this project we were provided with the front end code and were required to create a Mongo Database and handle routes using Express. 

The resulting application allows the user to view, create, and track their daily workouts. The user can log multiple exercises for a workout, tracking the workout by name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. The user will then be able to see the total duration of their workout.

The application gives the user the ability to reach their fitness goals more efficiently when they are able to track their workout progress. 

## Installation

It is not required to install anything for this application.

You will instead need the following packages to run the app:

 *Mongoose
